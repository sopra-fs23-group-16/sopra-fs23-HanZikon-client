## Introduction

Hanzi (Chinese pinyin) means Chinese character. HanZikon is a Chinese character learning and writing APP.

It has three game modes, Riddle of Oracle Script, Hanzi Imitation and Bit of Both Mode.
1. In Riddle of Oracle Script mode, player needs to choose the right chinese character of current age based on the oracle bone script dated back to 1500BC.
2. In Hanzi Imitation mode, player would draw or paint the Chinese Character with short-term memory. Generally, there would be 15- 30 seconds for players to learn the shape and structure of the Chinese character, then 15 seconds for players to reproduce it. There would be three game modes with different levels (eg, 1 -5 from easy to hard ), players are free to choose the mode and level they prefer.
3. In Bit of Both mode, player will have questions combined in above modes mentioned.

The aim of this application is getting to know Chinese characters in an interesting way. Or one can just simply take it as a game to practice your memory or painting skills with fun.

## Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [React](https://react.dev/learn) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible) - Deployment
- [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) - Web services for user control
- [Websocket](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/) -  Real-time bidirectional communication between client and server
- [Google Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) - Provide multi-linguial support

## High-level Components

## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

In the Game Settings feature, users can customize various aspects of the game, including the number of players, question types, difficulty levels, and number of rounds. The number of players refers to the maximum limit of participants in a game room.

## Roadmap

### Tourist Mode

Our application currently only supports registered users. However, the separation of Player class and User allows further introducing a guest mode. By implementing a guest mode, users who haven't registered or logged in can still access and enjoy certain features of the application.

### Single-player Mode

Single-player mode can be designed as a limited feature to registered users by offering graded difficulty levels that allow them to progress through different stages and unlock new challenges. Additionally, the system can provide a way for guests to track and improve their performance by refreshing their records.

### Game History

For registered users, they can have access to advanced features that allow them to record both single-player game progress and multiplayer game records.

### Mobile Adaptability

Our application currently only caters to PC and tablet devices, and there is room for improvement in terms of the layout and scaling of the UI for mobile devices.
